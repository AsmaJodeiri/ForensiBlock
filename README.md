# ForensiBlock:


#  A Provenance-Driven Blockchain Framework for Data Forensics and Auditability



>  Forensiblock incorporates Role-Based Access Control with Staged Authorization (RBAC-SA) and a distributed Merkle root for case tracking. These features support authorized resource access with an efficient retrieval of provenance records. Particularly, comparing two methods for extracting provenance records – off-chain storage retrieval with Merkle root verification and a brute-force search – the off-chain method is significantly better, especially as the blockchain size and number of cases increase
